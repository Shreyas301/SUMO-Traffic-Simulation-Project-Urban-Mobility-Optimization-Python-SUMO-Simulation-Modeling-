# SUMO-Traffic-Simulation-Project-Urban-Mobility-Optimization-Python-SUMO-Simulation-Modeling-

Built a traffic simulation model using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to analyze vehicle movement, signal timing, and traffic density patterns.

Imported and cleaned network data, configured route files, and simulated realistic urban traffic scenarios.

Designed Python scripts using TraCI API to control and monitor traffic lights, vehicle behavior, and lane changes dynamically.

Conducted performance evaluations using KPIs such as vehicle throughput, waiting time, congestion hotspots, and emission levels.

Experimented with optimization strategies (signal timing adjustments, routing variations) and compared results across simulation runs.

Documented findings in Jupyter Notebooks and visualized outputs using Matplotlib for technical insights.

Strengthened knowledge of modeling, algorithmic thinking, and system simulation, highly relevant for computational research roles.
